# Fitting Algorithms â€“ Radioisotope Spectra Processing

These scripts support the senior design project on radioisotope identification. They perform curve fitting and feature extraction on simulated gamma spectra to prepare inputs for classification models.

## Functions
- Peak smoothing and denoising using Savitzky-Golay filter
- Second derivative method for peak detection
- Curve fitting (Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt profiles) to extract peak positions and intensities
- Exporting feature vectors for machine learning

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, SciPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (
